# video-timeline-copilot

Create editable video timelines with Codex.

<img width="843" height="516" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7ab61ca-5c17-4325-b861-59f152a4e9a0" />

Drop footage in a folder, ask Codex for an edit, and get structured handoff
files back: `edl.json`, `.srt`, and `.fcpxml`. If DaVinci Resolve Studio
external scripting is available, it can also build a native Resolve project.

The primary output is an editable timeline, not a flattened MP4.

## What It Does

- Inventories local video files into `edit/media_index.json`.
- Analyzes visual video signals into `edit/video_analysis/` using local FFmpeg
  scene/freeze detection and sampled frame references.
- Transcribes footage with `faster-whisper` and word timestamps.
- Packs transcripts and cached visual signals into `edit/takes_packed.md`, the
  main reading surface for the agent.
- Flags likely repeated takes in the packed transcript so Codex can keep the
  cleanest delivery instead of cutting in multiple versions of the same line.
- Creates deterministic draft silence-cut timelines with configurable thresholds
  and transcript-aware word-boundary snapping.
- Separates mixed source audio into Demucs stems so buried voice and background
  music can be adjusted on separate tracks.
- Documents Shorts-specific editing defaults for hook, pacing, vertical framing,
  captions, B-roll, and QA.
- Lets Codex reason about the edit and write `edit/edl.json`.
- Validates the EDL before any editor-specific export and warns about obvious
  cut-craft problems when transcript timings are available.
- Exports `.srt` subtitles.
- Exports `.fcpxml` for manual import into Resolve Free, Final Cut Pro, or
  other tools that support FCPXML.
- Renders optional MP4 previews directly from `edl.json` and writes automated
  QA reports with contact sheets before handoff.
- Evaluates validation, cut quality, preview QA, and agent-review criteria so
  weak outputs can be revised before final handoff.
- Optionally builds `.drp` / `.dra` projects through the DaVinci Resolve
  scripting API when external scripting is available.

## Setup

Install the agent skill with `skills.sh`:

```bash
npx skills add ludmila-omlopes/video-timeline-copilot -g -a codex
```

Then install the Python helper CLI with `uv`:

```bash
uv tool install "video-timeline-copilot[transcribe] @ git+https://github.com/ludmila-omlopes/video-timeline-copilot.git@main"
vtc --help
```

The `npx skills add` command installs the `SKILL.md` instructions. The `uv`
command installs the `vtc` helper CLI used for media inventory, transcription,
EDL validation, subtitles, FCPXML, previews, and Resolve handoff.

When testing from a local checkout, prefer installing from GitHub after pushing
or use the bundled installer. `npx skills add .` copies the local directory as
it exists on disk, including ignored folders such as `.venv` if they are present.

`skills.sh` does not run post-install hooks from skills. If the helper CLI is
not installed when the skill is first used, the skill tells the agent to ask
before running the bootstrap commands documented in `install.md`. The skill
also tells the agent to refresh PATH after installing `uv`/`vtc` and verify
`vtc --help` in the current shell before continuing. The agent should only use a
manual FFmpeg/Python fallback if the user refuses to install `vtc` or `uv` and
still asks it to continue.

If you prefer one command that installs the helper CLI and registers the skill
for Claude and Codex, use the bundled installer:

```bash
uv tool install "video-timeline-copilot[transcribe] @ git+https://github.com/ludmila-omlopes/video-timeline-copilot.git@main"
video-timeline-copilot install
```

Update later with:

```bash
npx skills update video-timeline-copilot
video-timeline-copilot update
```

After setup, point Codex at a footage folder:

```text
Use video-timeline-copilot on this folder and remove the silent parts from the
video.
```

Other examples:

```text
Use video-timeline-copilot on this folder and create a 30 second highlight edit.
```

```text
Use video-timeline-copilot on this folder and make a rough cut from the best
spoken moments.
```

Codex should infer the source video, create/use `edit/`, inventory sources,
transcribe, pack the transcript, create the internal EDL, validate it, and export
the handoff files. All session outputs live in the footage folder's `edit/`
directory; the skill directory stays clean.

## Manual Install

Most users should use the `skills.sh` and `uv` setup above. Manual setup has two
parts:

1. The **agent skill** is installed by placing this repo under a Claude or
   Codex skills folder.
2. The **Python helper CLI** is installed into a Python environment so commands
   like `vtc transcribe` are available.

The recommended manual CLI install uses `uv` instead of a hand-managed virtual
environment:

```bash
uv tool install "video-timeline-copilot[transcribe] @ git+https://github.com/ludmila-omlopes/video-timeline-copilot.git@main"
vtc --help
```

Then either run `video-timeline-copilot install` or place/symlink this
repository into your agent skill folder.

```powershell
# 1. Clone the repo directly into the Codex skills folder
mkdir $env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
git clone https://github.com/ludmila-omlopes/video-timeline-copilot.git `
  $env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\video-timeline-copilot
cd $env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\video-timeline-copilot

# 2. Verify the CLI installed by uv
vtc --help
```

Install FFmpeg separately and make sure `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are on `PATH`.
Install the optional Demucs extra when you want local stem separation:

```bash
uv tool install --force "video-timeline-copilot[transcribe,demucs] @ git+https://github.com/ludmila-omlopes/video-timeline-copilot.git@main"
```

On macOS/Linux, the skill registration step is usually:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
git clone https://github.com/ludmila-omlopes/video-timeline-copilot.git \
  ~/.codex/skills/video-timeline-copilot
cd ~/.codex/skills/video-timeline-copilot
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[transcribe]"
vtc --help
```

## Development

Contributor and agent guidelines (dev setup, repo map, conventions, CI gates)
live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Platform Compatibility

Current status:

- Windows: primary tested platform for the CLI workflow.
- Linux: expected to work for inventory, transcription, EDL validation, SRT, and
  FCPXML export, but not yet fully validated end to end.
- macOS: expected to work for the same CLI/FCPXML path, but not yet validated.
- DaVinci Resolve scripting: platform-specific and currently documented with
  Windows paths only.

The recommended cross-platform handoff is FCPXML:

```bash
vtc export-fcpxml /path/to/footage/edit/edl.json
```

Broader Linux/macOS testing and platform-specific Resolve setup docs are planned
for a later compatibility pass.

## Footage Folder

Use a separate workspace for each edit:

```text
my-video/
  raw/
    interview.mp4
  edit/
```

Generated files go under `edit/`:

```text
my-video/edit/
  media_index.json
  video_analysis/
  video_analysis.md
  video_frames/
  transcripts/
  takes_packed.md
  edl.json
  subtitles/
  My_Edit.fcpxml
  previews/
  qa/
  resolve/
```

## Examples

See [examples/](examples/) for small, media-free example workspaces that show
the expected `media_index.json`, transcript JSON, `takes_packed.md`, and
`edl.json` files for silence-removal and highlight-edit workflows.

## CLI Quickstart

```powershell
vtc inventory .\my-video --edit-dir .\my-video\edit
vtc analyze-video .\my-video\raw\interview.mp4 --edit-dir .\my-video\edit
vtc transcribe .\my-video\raw\interview.mp4 --edit-dir .\my-video\edit
vtc pack-transcripts --edit-dir .\my-video\edit
vtc draft-silence-cut .\my-video\raw\interview.mp4 --edit-dir .\my-video\edit
vtc refine-audio-cuts .\my-video\edit\edl.json --replace
vtc separate-audio .\my-video\raw\interview.mp4 --edit-dir .\my-video\edit
vtc validate-edl .\my-video\edit\edl.json
vtc export-srt .\my-video\edit\edl.json
vtc export-fcpxml .\my-video\edit\edl.json
vtc import-fcpxml .\my-video\edit\Adjusted.fcpxml --base-edl .\my-video\edit\edl.json
vtc render-preview .\my-video\edit\edl.json
vtc qa-preview .\my-video\edit\edl.json
vtc evaluate-edl .\my-video\edit\edl.json --require-preview --strict-cut-warnings
```

`vtc transcribe` defaults to `--device auto --compute-type auto`. On Windows,
if `faster-whisper` detects CUDA but the CUDA runtime DLLs are missing, for
example `cublas64_12.dll`, the helper retries on CPU with `int8`. To skip GPU
probing entirely, run:

```powershell
vtc transcribe .\my-video\raw\interview.mp4 --edit-dir .\my-video\edit --device cpu --compute-type int8
```

If you explicitly pass `--device cuda`, CUDA errors are left visible so the
local NVIDIA/CUDA installation can be fixed instead of silently using CPU.

`vtc pack-transcripts` annotates nearby repeated deliveries as
`possible repeated take`. Those notes are meant for the editing pass: keep only
the cleanest complete version of a restarted sentence or repeated point unless
the repetition is intentionally part of the video.

It also annotates partial restarts and immediate corrections as
`possible self-correction/restart`. Tune that detector with
`--restart-overlap-words` and `--restart-max-gap` when a transcript needs a
stricter or looser pass.

`vtc analyze-video` adds a local visual context layer before the agent chooses
cuts:

```powershell
vtc analyze-video .\my-video\raw\interview.mp4 --edit-dir .\my-video\edit
```

Default outputs:

```text
my-video/edit/video_analysis/interview.json
my-video/edit/video_analysis.md
my-video/edit/video_frames/interview/frame_000001.jpg
```

The helper uses FFmpeg only: sampled frames, scene-change timestamps, and
freeze/near-static ranges. It does not run OCR, face recognition, object
detection, or a hosted vision model by default, so there is no extra model cost
beyond local FFmpeg runtime. When more specific visual understanding is needed,
review the sampled frames or add external/model observations to the
`observations` array in `edit/video_analysis/<source>.json`, then rerun
`vtc pack-transcripts`. If video analysis is unavailable, `takes_packed.md`
states that the workflow is using transcript-only context.

`vtc draft-silence-cut` creates an editable rough cut by detecting silence with
FFmpeg, then using transcript word timestamps to split long no-speech gaps when
transcripts are available. It writes kept ranges into `edit/edl.json`. Defaults
are conservative:

```powershell
vtc draft-silence-cut .\my-video\raw\interview.mp4 --edit-dir .\my-video\edit --style documentary
```

Useful controls:

- `--noise -35dB`: silence threshold passed to FFmpeg `silencedetect`.
- `--min-silence 0.7`: minimum sustained silence before a gap is removed.
- `--padding 0.25`: pre/post-roll kept around detected activity.
- `--min-segment 0.8`: discard tiny kept fragments; the CLI enforces at least
  0.8 seconds.
- `--merge-gap 0.35`: merge nearby kept ranges.
- `--max-word-gap 0.8`: split transcript word gaps longer than this many seconds.
- `--style social|highlight|documentary|longform`: pacing preset.
- `--no-word-snap`: skip transcript word-boundary adjustment.

When `edit/transcripts/<source>.json` exists, the helper adjusts cut points to
word timings so draft silence cuts do not trim through spoken words, and it
removes long pauses even when the audio is not technically silent. See
[docs/audio-analysis.md](docs/audio-analysis.md) for detector tradeoffs.
Because ASR word timestamps can end slightly before the audible phoneme tail,
run audio refinement before validation/export:

```powershell
vtc refine-audio-cuts .\my-video\edit\edl.json --replace
```

This reads the source audio around each cut and expands boundaries outward only
when RMS activity is found close to the current `source_start` or `source_end`.
EDL validation reports kept transcript gaps longer than the configured
`max_word_gap`, cuts inside words, and transcript-backed sentence/segment spans
that are only partially preserved; self-evaluation treats speech-boundary
issues as blockers.

## Audio Stem Separation

Use `vtc separate-audio` when a voice is baked into background music and you
need separate files to rebalance in an editor:

```powershell
vtc separate-audio .\my-video\raw\interview.mp4 --edit-dir .\my-video\edit
```

The command extracts source audio to `edit/audio/extracted/`, runs Demucs, and
writes stems under:

```text
my-video/edit/audio/demucs/htdemucs/<source>/
  vocals.wav
  no_vocals.wav
  vtc_stems.json
```

The default mode is a two-stem vocal split, which is the useful path for
lowering music under spoken voice. For broader music separation:

```powershell
vtc separate-audio .\my-video\raw\interview.mp4 --edit-dir .\my-video\edit --mode 4-stem
```

That writes `vocals.wav`, `drums.wav`, `bass.wav`, and `other.wav`. Demucs is
optional and local, but it may download model weights the first time a model is
used.

If the FCPXML has already been created and you want to keep updating that same
file instead of choosing new output names, run:

```powershell
vtc update-fcpxml .\my-video\edit\edl.json
```

For a custom XML path:

```powershell
vtc update-fcpxml .\my-video\edit\edl.json --xml .\my-video\edit\current.fcpxml
```

If you manually adjust the imported timeline in Resolve, Final Cut Pro, or
another FCPXML-compatible editor, export a fresh `.fcpxml` from that editor and
sync the edited cuts back into a new EDL:

```powershell
vtc import-fcpxml .\my-video\edit\Adjusted.fcpxml --base-edl .\my-video\edit\edl.json
```

Default outputs:

```text
my-video/edit/edl.imported.json
my-video/edit/qa/fcpxml_import_report.json
```

Use `--replace` only when you want the imported version to replace the base
`edl.json`; the command validates a temporary import first and writes
`edl.bak.json` before replacing. Use `--strict` when unknown XML clips should
fail the import instead of being skipped with a warning.

For Resolve Free, import the generated `.fcpxml` manually:

```text
File > Import > Timeline > Import AAF, EDL, XML...
```

## Preview and QA

`vtc render-preview` creates an MP4 proxy from the EDL without requiring
Resolve:

```powershell
vtc render-preview .\my-video\edit\edl.json
```

Default output:

```text
my-video/edit/previews/<project>_preview.mp4
```

The renderer cuts linked audio and video together from each EDL range. If the
timeline has record gaps, overlaps, or clips shorter than the minimum clip
duration, validation fails before preview rendering instead of creating
black/silent filler.

Run QA after rendering:

```powershell
vtc qa-preview .\my-video\edit\edl.json
```

Default outputs:

```text
my-video/edit/qa/preview_report.json
my-video/edit/qa/contact_sheet.jpg
```

The report includes expected versus actual duration, cut/source counts, record
gaps, record overlaps, short clips, transform zoom/position coverage, and
audio-only or video-only regions when a range or source stream appears to lack
linked audio/video. Use `--preview`, `--report`, `--contact-sheet`, or
`--timeline` to override the defaults.

## Self-Evaluation

Run `vtc evaluate-edl` after validation, export, preview rendering, and QA:

```powershell
vtc evaluate-edl .\my-video\edit\edl.json --require-preview --strict-cut-warnings --attempt 1 --max-attempts 3
```

Default output:

```text
my-video/edit/qa/evaluation_report.json
```

The evaluation report combines EDL validation, cut-quality warnings, preview QA,
and agent-review criteria for prompt alignment, pacing, and visual coherence. It
returns one of three statuses:

- `pass`: machine checks passed; finish the listed agent review before handoff.
- `needs_revision`: revise `edit/edl.json`, rerun exports/preview/QA, and call
  `evaluate-edl` again with the next `--attempt` value.
- `blocked`: the edit still fails after `--max-attempts`; stop and report the
  blockers instead of continuing to iterate.

Record gaps, overlaps, clips shorter than the minimum duration, cuts inside
words, long kept transcript gaps, and partially preserved transcript-backed
sentences/segments are blockers. Use `--strict-cut-warnings` for final
speech-edit handoff so any future cut-quality warning also blocks delivery.

## DaVinci Resolve

`vtc export-fcpxml` is the default fallback for users who cannot use Resolve
external scripting.

`vtc build-resolve-project` requires:

- DaVinci Resolve installed on the same machine.
- DaVinci Resolve Studio, or another edition/version that exposes external
  scripting.
- External scripting enabled in Resolve preferences.
- Resolve open when the command runs.
- Python able to import `DaVinciResolveScript`.

On Windows, typical environment variables look like:

```powershell
$env:RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API="C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Developer\Scripting"
$env:RESOLVE_SCRIPT_LIB="C:\Program Files\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\fusionscript.dll"
$env:PYTHONPATH="$env:PYTHONPATH;$env:RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API\Modules"
```

Then:

```powershell
vtc resolve-env-check
vtc build-resolve-project .\my-video\edit\edl.json
```

To keep working inside an existing Resolve project that is already open, update
that project instead of creating a new one:

```powershell
vtc update-resolve-timeline .\my-video\edit\edl.json --project "Existing Project"
```

By default this creates uniquely named timelines when a timeline with the same
name already exists. To intentionally replace matching timelines:

```powershell
vtc update-resolve-timeline .\my-video\edit\edl.json --project "Existing Project" --replace-existing
```

This rebuilds timelines from the EDL; it does not live-patch individual clips
inside the selected timeline. If the existing Resolve project frame rate differs
from the EDL fps, the command stops unless `--allow-fps-mismatch` is provided.

Updating an FCPXML file on disk does not make Resolve refresh a timeline that
was already imported from that XML. Resolve treats XML import as a timeline
snapshot, so reimport the updated XML or use `vtc update-resolve-timeline` when
Resolve scripting is available.

If `vtc resolve-env-check` reports `api_import_ok_resolve_not_connected` and
your Resolve preferences do not show external scripting options, use FCPXML
instead.

## Security and Privacy Notes

- Transcription runs locally with `faster-whisper`, but the model may be
  downloaded from Hugging Face the first time it is used.
- Source media, transcripts, EDLs, subtitles, and FCPXML files can contain
  private content. They are written under the footage folder's `edit/`
  directory.
- Only run the workflow on media files you trust. `vtc inventory` calls
  `ffprobe`, so keeping FFmpeg updated matters.
- Do not commit generated footage, transcripts, subtitles, or `edit/` outputs to
  a public repository.
- The EDL validator rejects source and subtitle paths that escape the footage
  workspace.

## How It Works

The model reasons about the edit. Deterministic helpers execute the workflow.

```text
local media
  -> media inventory
  -> FFmpeg video signal analysis
  -> faster-whisper transcript cache
  -> packed transcript and visual context for Codex
  -> agent-authored edl.json
  -> validation
  -> SRT / FCPXML / preview QA
  -> self-evaluation loop
  -> optional Resolve project
```

The EDL is the durable edit contract. It contains timeline names, source media,
source in/out times, record positions, resolution, subtitles, markers, and
optional transform and speed metadata.

Shorts cut from gameplay with a facecam overlay can use transform presets as
part of vertical framing:

```json
{
  "transform": {
    "preset": "gameplay-screen",
    "facecam": {"x": 0, "y": 720, "width": 320, "height": 360}
  }
}
```

`gameplay-facecam` crops into the facecam rectangle for reaction/commentary
beats. `gameplay-screen` uses the same rectangle to zoom into the largest
remaining gameplay region for screen-focused beats, centered so the facecam is
not shown again. Rectangle coordinates may be pixels or normalized `0.0`-`1.0`
values.

Ranges may include a constant `speed` playback multiplier. For example,
`"speed": 2.0` keeps the same source span but plays it at 200%, so the timeline
duration is half of `source_end - source_start`. FCPXML export writes these
retimes with Resolve-style `timeMap` entries, keeping the speed change editable
after import. Resolve scripting project creation does not support retimed
ranges yet; use the FCPXML path for edits with speed changes.

## Design Principles

1. Editable timelines are the primary output.
2. Transcript-first editing keeps the agent focused on meaningful cut points.
3. The LLM writes structured edit intent; helper scripts perform deterministic
   file generation.
4. Silence removal is a draft timeline generator, not the final creative edit.
5. Validate before exporting.
6. Evaluate before handoff and revise weak outputs within a bounded loop.
7. Keep all per-session outputs in the footage folder's `edit/` directory.
8. When Resolve scripting is unavailable, produce SRT and FCPXML instead of
   blocking the workflow.
